### Pedagogical Method Chosen
**Project-Based Learning (PBL)**

**Justification**:
Project-Based Learning (PBL) is ideal for exploring the use cases of GenAI in physiotherapy because it encourages learners to investigate real-world applications, collaborate on solutions, and develop critical thinking through hands-on, problem-centered projects.

### Lesson Plan: Exploring Use Cases of GenAI in Physiotherapy
**Grade Level/Target Audience**: High school or undergraduate students in health science, technology, or interdisciplinary fields.
**Duration**: 4â€“6 weeks (flexible depending on class schedule).

----

#### **Learning Objectives**
By the end of the project, learners will:
1. Identify and explain at least 5 distinct use cases of GenAI in physiotherapy.
2. Analyze the benefits and challenges of implementing GenAI in clinical settings.
3. Design a hypothetical solution or case study demonstrating GenAIâ€™s role in improving physiotherapy practices.

----

#### **Materials Needed**
- Access to academic databases (e.g., PubMed, Google Scholar) and AI tools (e.g., chatbots, generative models).
- Presentation software (PowerPoint, Canva, Prezi).
- Guest speaker(s): A physiotherapist or AI developer familiar with healthcare applications.
- Rubrics for assessment.

----

#### **Lesson Structure**

##### **Week 1: Introduction & Project Kickoff**
- **Day 1**: Introduce GenAI concepts (e.g., image processing, text-to-image generation, predictive analytics).
- **Day 2**: Overview of physiotherapy workflows (patient assessment, rehabilitation plans, documentation).
- **Day 3**: Define the project goal and form small groups (3â€“4 students per group). Each group selects a focus area (e.g., patient communication, exercise personalization, data analysis, virtual therapy assistants).
- **Day 4**: Assign roles (researcher, presenter, designer, ethicist).

##### **Weeks 2â€“3: Research Phase**
- Groups conduct independent research on their chosen GenAI use case in physiotherapy.
- Tasks:
  - Find existing examples of GenAI in their topic (e.g., AI-generated exercise videos, chatbots for patient follow-ups).
  - Investigate challenges (privacy concerns, data quality, AI outputs, cost barriers).
  - Interview a professional (optional) via email or video call.

##### **Week 4: Prototype Development**
- Groups create a **case study or prototype** (e.g., a mock-up of an AI-powered physiotherapy app, a script for a virtual assistant, or a report analyzing AI-driven diagnostics).
- Include visuals, explanations, and ethical considerations.

##### **Week 5: Peer Review & Refinement**
- Present drafts to peers for feedback.
- Revise projects based on input.

##### **Week 6: Final Presentations & Reflection**
- Groups present their findings and prototypes to the class.
- Host a Q&A session with guests (if applicable).
- Individual reflection: Students write a short essay on how GenAI could transform physiotherapy and their role in its future.

| Research Depth   | Accuracy, breadth, and relevance of information gathered.      | 30%       |
| Creativity       | Originality of the case study or prototype.                    | 25%       |
| Presentation Quality | Clarity, organization, and engagement during the presentation. | 20%    |
| Teamwork         | Contribution to group tasks and collaboration.                 | 15%       |
| Reflection Essay | Insightfulness and critical thinking in the final reflection.  | 10%       |

----

#### **Outcomes**
- Learners produce tangible projects (presentations, case studies, or prototypes) showcasing GenAIâ€™s potential in physiotherapy.
- Enhanced understanding of interdisciplinary applications of AI in healthcare.
- Critical awareness of ethical, technical, and practical challenges in adopting GenAI.

----

#### **Extensions/Adaptations**
- For advanced learners: Explore AI ethics in healthcare or compare GenAI with traditional methods.
- For younger students: Simplify the project to creating a poster or storyboard instead of a full case study.

This PBL approach ensures active, collaborative, and meaningful learning while addressing the complexities of GenAI in physiotherapy. ðŸ§ ðŸ¤–
