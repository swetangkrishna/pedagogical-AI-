Acquisition,hasDescription,"""When you listen to a facilitator , watch a video  or read from an online resource or book. Through engaging with these materials you acquire knowledge."""
Investigation,hasDescription,"""When you take an active and exploratory approach to learning through searching for and evaluating new information and ideas. By analysing, critiquing and comparing resources,  ideas and data,  you develop and further refine your knowledge and understanding of the concepts and ideas being taught."""
Practice,hasDescription,"""When you apply knowledge in context through actions e.g. implementing, generating,  or applying a concept or skill. Adapting actions according to the task,  and in response to feedback,  leads to enhancement of practice."""
Discussion,hasDescription,"""When you articulate and exchange ideas,  ask or respond to questions,  or challenge arguments (from your peers or facilitator). This enables you to develop a more thorough conceptual understanding of the topics at hand."""
Collaboration,hasDescription,"""When you work with peers in small groups to achieve a common goal,  for example the production of a shared output. Collaboration involves elements of discussion,  practice and production and enables you to collaboratively and actively build knowledge with your peers."""
Production,hasDescription,"""When you produce something (e.g. an artefact, a plan,  a video or an infographic) to demonstrate what and how you have learned. This type of learning activity can be performed individually (distinguishing it from collaboration)."""
