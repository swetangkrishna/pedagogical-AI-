Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to choose a pedagogical method, justify it, and create a lesson plan based on the given context and query.

First, the query is about GenAI use cases and specifically its application in physiotherapy. Looking at the themes provided, Theme 5 discusses examples from disciplines, including physiotherapy. The context mentions a case study where students used GenAI tools like Gemini and ChatGPT for differential diagnosis in physiotherapy. 

The available methods are didactic, project-based learning, inquiry-based learning, or design thinking. Since the query involves exploring specific use cases and applications in a field (physiotherapy), inquiry-based learning seems suitable. Inquiry-based learning encourages students to explore and investigate real-world problems, which aligns with analyzing GenAI's role in physiotherapy through case studies and discussions. 

Justification: Inquiry-based learning allows learners to explore real-world applications of GenAI in physiotherapy through guided investigation and discussion, fostering deeper understanding and critical analysis.

Now, structuring the lesson plan. The theme 5 has learning activities like acquisition (self-study), discussion, and production. The lesson should include an introduction to GenAI in physiotherapy, guided inquiry with case studies, group discussions, and a reflective activity. Aligning with the learning outcomes of exploring pedagogical practices and reflecting on GenAI integration.

Need to ensure that the lesson incorporates the case study mentioned in the context, where students analyze a case using GenAI tools. Also, include steps for investigation, discussion, and reflection. Maybe start with a lecture on GenAI basics, then move into case study analysis, group work, and a presentation or report. Ensure that the activities match the defined learning objectives and utilize the specified learning activities from the themes.

**Chosen Pedagogical Method:** Inquiry-Based Learning  
**Justification:** Inquiry-based learning fosters critical exploration of real-world applications, enabling learners to investigate GenAI's role in physiotherapy through case studies, discussions, and analysis of ethical and practical implications.

### **Lesson Plan: Exploring GenAI Use Cases and Applications in Physiotherapy**  
**Duration:** 3 hours  
**Target Audience:** Undergraduate physiotherapy students  

#### **Learning Objectives:**  
1. Identify key use cases of GenAI in healthcare and physiotherapy.  
2. Analyze ethical, technical, and practical challenges of GenAI in clinical settings.  
3. Propose evidence-based strategies for integrating GenAI into physiotherapy practice.  

---

#### **Lesson Structure:**  

**1. Introduction to GenAI in Healthcare (30 mins)**  
- **Activity:** Mini-lecture + interactive Q&A.  
  - Define GenAI and its relevance to healthcare (e.g., differential diagnosis, administrative tasks).  
  - Highlight examples from the context (e.g., Gemini/ChatGPT for red flag identification).  
  - Pose guiding question: *"How might GenAI transform physiotherapy workflows while maintaining patient safety?"*  

**2. Guided Inquiry: Case Study Analysis (60 mins)**  
- **Activity:** Small-group investigation using a provided case study (e.g., a patient with covert red flags).  
  - Students use GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) to generate differential diagnoses and compare results with peers.  
  - Tasks:  
    - Identify strengths/limitations of GenAI outputs.  
    - Discuss ethical concerns (e.g., over-reliance on AI, bias in diagnostic suggestions).  
  - Facilitator provides structured prompts: *"What clinical guidelines would you cross-reference with AI suggestions?"*  

**3. Collaborative Discussion (45 mins)**  
- **Activity:** Group debate on GenAI's role in physiotherapy.  
  - Topics:  
    - Should AI-assisted diagnosis replace clinician judgment?  
    - How can GenAI improve patient accessibility (e.g., telehealth, personalized rehab plans)?  
  - Encourage use of evidence from the context (e.g., "GenAI for administrative tasks" vs. "clinical decision-making").  

**4. Reflection and Action Planning (45 mins)**  
- **Activity:** Individual reflection + peer feedback.  
  - Students write a short response: *"One way I could ethically integrate GenAI into my future practice is…"*  
  - Groups share ideas; facilitator highlights examples from the context (e.g., using GenAI for "automated captioning" in patient education videos).  

**5. Wrap-Up and Resources (15 mins)**  
- Recap key takeaways: GenAI's potential to augment—not replace—clinical expertise.  
- Distribute supplementary resources (e.g., PAIR Framework, Traffic Light Model from Theme 4) for further exploration.  

---

#### **Assessment:**  
- Participation in case study analysis and debate.  
- Quality of individual reflection (aligned with LO3: Reflect on pedagogical practices).  
- Peer feedback on proposed GenAI integration strategies.  

This plan leverages inquiry-based learning to deepen engagement with GenAI's complexities in physiotherapy, balancing technical exploration with ethical reflection.
